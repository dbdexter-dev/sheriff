# Sheriff.c
* Implement preview window
* Implement window scrolling
* Reduce the number of #define directives in sheriff.c
* Enable top bar truncation a la fish
* Implement directory list caching

# Makefile
* Add release target (-O2 and strip and stuff)

Also:
* The UI shits itself when unicode is involved
* Running it in a TTY shows how bad the refreshing really is
